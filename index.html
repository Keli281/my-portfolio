        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Natalie Awinja, a second-year Computer Science student with aspirations to specialize in AI/ML engineering and data science. With a strong passion for technology and innovation, I'm committed to sharpening my skills in programming, problem-solving, and collaborative development. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer capable of building scalable, user-centered solutions that address real-world challenges.
<br>
I have foundational knowledge in C programming language, HTML, and CSS, and I'm currently focused on building a strong technical base in Python, Git, and MySQL to support my journey into intelligent systems and data-driven development. Every line of code I write brings me closer to the impactful career I envision.</p>
